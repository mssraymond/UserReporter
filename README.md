# User Reporter

## Context

### Imagine you're creating a simple system that allows users of a social platform to report/unreport bad actors

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure you have CMake and Docker installed

### 2. Execute `run.sh` (optionally with "docker" or "python" as a parameter)

- `./run.sh`: Runs the C++ executable
- `./run.sh docker`: Runs the C++ executable in a Docker container
- `./run.sh python`: Builds the C++ library into a Python-importable module, then runs the Python script

#### \*All 3 options are functionally identical\*

##### *Have fun!* ðŸ¤—
